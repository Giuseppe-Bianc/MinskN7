# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

To report a security issue, please email us at security@example.com. Please refrain from creating a public GitHub issue for security-related concerns, so we can address the issue before it becomes public.

When reporting security issues, please include the following details in your email:

- A brief description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
- Any relevant technical details or logs.

Our team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours, and we will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will keep you informed of the progress and when a fix is ready for deployment.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you adhere to responsible disclosure practices when reporting security issues to us. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Providing us with reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before public disclosure.
- Avoiding the use of automated tools to identify vulnerabilities.
- Making a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.

## Security Updates

Our team regularly monitors and updates the project to ensure the latest security best practices are implemented. We highly recommend that you keep your dependencies and the project up to date to benefit from these improvements.

## Supported Versions

We will prioritize security updates for the latest stable release of the project. If you are using an older version, we encourage you to upgrade to the latest release to receive the most recent security fixes.

## Bug Bounty Program

At the moment, we do not offer any bug bounty program. However, we are grateful for your contributions in identifying security issues and will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
